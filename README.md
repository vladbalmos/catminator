# About
This is a work in progress project. 

Components: 

    - Distance sensor (HC-SR04)
    - AirWick Freshmatic (Code: ARW00171)
    - Raspberry Pico

The Pico uses the distance sensor to detect any objects/animals/human (preferably a cat) then drives the AirWick's motors (TP7 & TP8) to spray the detected object in the hopes to scare it away.

Thank you BigClive for reverse engineering the AirWick. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OC4U6FiJus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OC4U6FiJus).
